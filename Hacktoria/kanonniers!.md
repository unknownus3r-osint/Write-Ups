# kanonniers!

### Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We are on the hunt for operatives of a competing organization. We believe them to be the continuation of a rival Order “The Golden Creed”, who we eradicated mid 18th century. Somehow the family running the Order managed to reorganize and fund new endeavors. Flying under the radar for several years, they now have a foothold in many European countries.

Unfortunately for them, they’ve chosen to cross paths with some of our bigger clients in several of these countries. Most recently, the Dutch intelligence agency AIVD, started investigating them after being linked to a human trafficking ring. All beginning with the Syrian refugee crisis a few years back.

What made this Order fly under the radar for many years, is their total aversion for the digital world. Barely dipping their toes in web 1.0, The Golden Creed uses mostly analog means of communication. Making them infinitely harder to track.

Our friends at the AIVD however once observed a member of The Golden Creed insert a package into an opening of a monument. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be instructions for a hit being placed by a client of The Golden Creed.

This leads us to your objective. Last week, an operative of The Golden Creed was arrested by Dutch police. Carrying a picture with him of an old cannon. Given their tendency to hide information in historical objects, we believe this particular cannon is a location of interest. Possibly holding information, or being frequently used to pass information.

Our client has asked us to locate the cannon. Use the image below to find the location of the cannon.

2. Went to website https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/elburg-stadswandeling-55962141 from the google lens results to confirm that it was the same kanon.

4. Once I've confirmed that it was the same kanon, went to https://what3words.com/, searched for Elburg, Netherlands and looked for the same spot that I found from the wikiloc site.

   Note: The castle icon showing where the spot of kanon is slightly off. 

6. Now that I had the what3words for the kanon, did a quick google search for the area code for Elburg, Netherlands. The result was 0525.

7. Combined the area code and what3words to get 0525-elburg-punk-runways-messed, unlocking the zip file for the badge.

### Concluding Thoughts:

``` 
Thanks for creating the challenge it was fun, didn't think it was too difficult. It could of just been that I got lucky with the google lens results. If I were to guess, from the looks of it this kanon might be a pretty popular historical landmark (or at least the city that it is located in is pretty popular) and so there could be a lot of pictures of it out there on google and other search engines.
