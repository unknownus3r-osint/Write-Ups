# the-cartel-connection!

### Briefing:

```
Greetings, Special Agent K.

We were contacted by our friends at the National Police of Colombia. They’ve been investigating a drug cartel. Now this is not anything new, especially in their region. However, last week one of their undercover operatives went missing.

Special Agent “Diego Alejandro Martinez Nunez” went dark for several days, after which his handler received a single photograph with the text “help, they will kill me”. Not a trace was found after this contact, which occurred yesterday afternoon at 14:37 Colombia Standard Time.

There is a slim chance the special agent is still alive. We also know the cartel operates only inside Colombia, mostly involved in moving goods overseas using various ships. This should narrow our search down to mostly coastal regions.

Your assignment is to find where the picture was taken. Colombian police is on high alert and ready to move as soon as we have a location.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept
